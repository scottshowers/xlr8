**After:** Removed completely - you now have maximum workspace!

**Benefit:** Reclaimed valuable screen real estate for actual work

### 3. ✅ Foundation Intelligence for Local LLM
**NEW Feature Added!**

**Location:** Sidebar - Expandable section  
**Purpose:** Upload cross-project knowledge that trains your local LLM

**What it is:**
A centralized knowledge base for your local LLM that applies across ALL projects. Upload industry standards, best practices, UKG documentation, and templates once - they're available to the LLM for all customer implementations.

**Where to Upload:**
```
Sidebar → 🧠 Foundation Intelligence (click to expand)
→ Upload Foundation Files button
```

**Supported File Types:**
- PDF (UKG guides, manuals)
- DOCX (templates, procedures)
- TXT/MD (knowledge articles)
- XLSX/CSV (configuration templates, data standards)

**Example Content:**
- UKG Pro configuration guides
- WFM best practices documents
- Standard pay code templates
- Accrual policy frameworks
- Industry regulations (FLSA, DOL, etc.)
- Implementation checklists
- Troubleshooting guides
- Data conversion standards

**How it Works:**
1. Upload files to Foundation Intelligence
2. Local LLM indexes and learns from content
3. LLM uses this knowledge across all projects
4. Consultants get better, more informed AI assistance
5. Update anytime - add new best practices as you learn

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Train once, use everywhere
- ✅ Consistent AI guidance across projects
- ✅ Build institutional knowledge
- ✅ Improve AI accuracy over time
- ✅ All stays local (private, secure)

## 🔄 How Foundation Intelligence Differs from Project Files

### Foundation Intelligence (Sidebar)
- **Scope:** ALL projects
- **Purpose:** Train local LLM
- **Content:** General knowledge, best practices, standards
- **Examples:** UKG guides, industry regulations, templates
- **Usage:** LLM references automatically
- **Location:** Shared across entire application

### Project Files (Main Content)
- **Scope:** Single project/customer
- **Purpose:** Parse and analyze customer data
- **Content:** Customer-specific files
- **Examples:** Pay registers, employee rosters, org charts
- **Usage:** Direct processing and analysis
- **Location:** Isolated per project

**Think of it as:**
- Foundation Intelligence = "What the LLM knows"
- Project Files = "What you're working on"
