---

## OPENING — THE PROBLEM (0:00 - 0:30)

### SCREEN: Black/dark background with text appearing

**[TEXT ON SCREEN]**  
*"Every project starts the same way."*

**NARRATION:**
> "Every project starts the same way.
> 
> Before anyone can fix anything, someone has to figure out what's actually going on.
> 
> That's weeks of discovery. Data pulls. Interviews. Spreadsheets. Guesswork dressed up as methodology.
> 
> That's the tax. And everyone pays it."

**[TEXT ON SCREEN]**  
*"What if you didn't have to?"*

---

## SCREEN 1: CREATE PROJECT (0:30 - 0:50)

### SCREEN: Project creation form

**NARRATION:**
> "XLR8 starts simple. New project. Who's the client. What system. What kind of engagement.
> 
> No 47-page intake questionnaire. No requirements gathering sessions. Just the basics — the platform will learn the rest from the data."

**KEY VISUAL:** Form fields filling in — Acme Corporation, UKG Pro, Implementation

**[TIMING NOTE]:** Quick cuts, show the simplicity

---

## SCREEN 2: UPLOAD DATA (0:50 - 1:15)

### SCREEN: Upload interface with files dropping in

**NARRATION:**
> "Then the data goes in.
> 
> Excel. CSV. PDF. Whatever the client can export, we can read.
> 
> No special templates. No reformatting. No 'please restructure your data so our system can understand it.'
> 
> Just drag, drop, and let the platform work."

**KEY VISUAL:** Multiple files uploading, progress bars filling, different file type icons

**[TIMING NOTE]:** Show variety of file types, emphasize ease

---

## SCREEN 3: AUTO-ANALYSIS (1:15 - 1:50)

### SCREEN: Processing animation with "Consultant Time Equivalent" banner

**NARRATION:**
> "This is where XLR8 earns its name.
> 
> Schema detection. Data profiling. Pattern analysis. Finding generation.
> 
> The platform reads the data, understands its structure, and looks for problems — automatically.
> 
> What you're watching right now? This is 17 hours of consultant work. Spreadsheet comparisons. Cross-referencing. Manual data validation.
> 
> That's $4,000 of effort. Happening in 3 minutes."

**KEY VISUAL:** Processing spinner, steps completing, cost-equivalent banner prominently displayed

**[TIMING NOTE]:** Let the cost number land. Pause on "$4,250 — 17 hours @ $250/hr"

---

## SCREEN 4: FINDINGS DASHBOARD (1:50 - 2:20)

### SCREEN: Findings dashboard with metrics and list

**NARRATION:**
> "And then you see what's wrong.
> 
> Not a 200-page report. Not 'we'll have findings for you in 6 weeks.'
> 
> Four critical issues. Seven warnings. Twelve recommendations. Right now.
> 
> Missing tax jurisdictions — 1,247 employees affected, $45,000 risk.
> Duplicate SSN records — audit flag.
> Pay group mismatches — payroll risk.
> 
> Prioritized. Categorized. Quantified.
> 
> Your consultants didn't discover this. The platform did. Your consultants decide what to do about it."

**KEY VISUAL:** Metric cards (4 critical, 7 warnings), findings list scrolling, severity badges

**[TIMING NOTE]:** Read 2-3 specific findings to show depth

---

## SCREEN 5: DRILL-IN DETAIL (2:20 - 2:50)

### SCREEN: Detail view of "Missing Tax Jurisdictions" finding

**NARRATION:**
> "Click any finding, and you get the full picture.
> 
> What we found. Why it matters. Who's affected — down to the individual record.
> 
> And most importantly: what to do about it.
> 
> Export the affected list. Cross-reference with addresses. Prepare the mass update file.
> 
> This isn't 'here's a problem, good luck.' This is 'here's exactly how to fix it.'
> 
> That's consultant-grade thinking at platform speed."

**KEY VISUAL:** Detail panel with affected records table, recommended actions section

**[TIMING NOTE]:** Scroll through the detail view, show the depth

---

## SCREEN 6: BUILD PLAYBOOK (2:50 - 3:15)

### SCREEN: Playbook builder with findings selected and actions generated

**NARRATION:**
> "Select your findings. Generate a playbook.
> 
> Findings become action items. Action items get assigned. Estimates get applied. Deadlines get set.
> 
> This is the deliverable.
> 
> Not a PowerPoint that gets emailed and forgotten. An actual plan. With owners. With timelines. With accountability."

**KEY VISUAL:** Checkbox selections, playbook generating, action items with assignees and dates

**[TIMING NOTE]:** Show the transformation from findings → actions

---

## SCREEN 7: TRACK PROGRESS (3:15 - 3:35)

### SCREEN: Progress tracker with completion statuses

**NARRATION:**
> "And then you track it.
> 
> What's done. What's in progress. What's blocked. What's next.
> 
> The client can see it. Your team can see it. No one's wondering what's happening.
> 
> This is how projects get delivered."

**KEY VISUAL:** Timeline with check marks, in-progress items, blocked item highlighted, "Risk mitigated: $49,250" banner

**[TIMING NOTE]:** Quick scan down the timeline

## CLOSING — THE MESSAGE (3:35 - 3:55)

### SCREEN: Clean screen with XLR8 logo

**NARRATION:**
> "Every project used to start with weeks of discovery.
> 
> Now it starts with answers.
> 
> Platform finds the problems. Consultants fix them. Clients see everything.
> 
> This is how analysis should work."

**[TEXT ON SCREEN]**  
*XLR8*  
*Analysis. Accelerated.*

### Voiceover Guidance

- **Pace:** Measured, not rushed. Let key numbers land.
- **Tone:** Confident authority. Not salesy, not apologetic.
- **Emphasis points:**
  - "17 hours of consultant work"
  - "$4,250 of effort. Happening in 3 minutes."
  - "Your consultants didn't discover this. The platform did."
  - "This isn't 'here's a problem, good luck.'"

### Visual Style

- Match XLR8 branding: Grass green (#83b16d), Electric blue (#2766b1), clean white backgrounds
- Subtle animations on transitions (fade, slide)
- Cost-equivalent banners should be prominent — this is the key differentiator
- No stock footage, no generic "business people pointing at screens"
- All screens should look like real software, not conceptual wireframes

### Music Suggestion

- Modern, minimal electronic
- Building energy but not overpowering
- Drops out for key moments (cost numbers, closing message)

> 47,000 records analyzed. 23 findings identified. $4,000 of consultant effort — in 3 minutes.
>
